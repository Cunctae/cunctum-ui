# Welcome

Cunctum UI is the web implementation of the [Cunctae](https://cunctae.com/) Design System.
Cunctae originated as a personal project aimed at encapsulating all the elements I wanted to include. The name "Cunctae" comes from Latin, meaning "everything," and when combined with "Cunctum," it signifies "all together," reflecting one of the primary purposes of this project.

This project has been developed using TypeScript and HTML, leveraging Vanilla JavaScript as the framework and CSS for styling all components. Cunctum UI aims to provide a cohesive and flexible design system that can be easily integrated into various web applications.
